📊 Data Analytics Project: Python, SQL & Power BI
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights.
The process includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying using PostgreSQL, and interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills commonly required in real-world business environments.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains structured business data (e.g., customer behavior, sales, transactions).

Data was initially loaded and explored using Python.

After cleaning and preprocessing, the data was stored in a PostgreSQL database for querying.

Final insights were visualized using Power BI.

(Dataset can be from Kaggle / internal source / sample business data)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

PostgreSQL (SQL queries for analysis)

Power BI (Dashboard & data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

pgAdmin

Git & GitHub

🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported dataset using Python (Pandas).

Checked data structure, column types, and basic statistics.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions and trends.

Identified missing values and outliers.

Used visualizations to understand relationships between variables.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values.

Corrected data types.

Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.

Prepared data for database insertion.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Wrote SQL queries for:

Aggregations

Grouping & filtering

Business performance metrics

Validated insights before visualization.

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL.

Created interactive dashboards with:

KPIs

Trend analysis

Category-wise breakdowns

Enabled filters and slicers for better insights.

📈 Dashboard Results

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Clear business KPIs

Customer and sales behavior trends

Data-driven insights for decision-making

Interactive filtering for deeper analysis
